# Welcome to the MMMRN Machine Learning and Deep Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to providing beginner-level tutorials on implementing machine learning and deep learning using Python. As the machine learning mentor for the Multiscale Mechanical Modelling and Research Network (MMMRN), I have created these resources to assist university batchmates, juniors, and mentees in their learning journey.

To make the learning process engaging and relatable, we utilize sports data from football and cricket. These real-world datasets help illustrate key concepts and techniques in an enjoyable and practical manner.

Feel free to explore the repository, follow along with the tutorials, and enhance your understanding of machine learning and deep learning through these fun and interactive examples.
